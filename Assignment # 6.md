```python
# Question: 1

# It refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriente programming
# aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in
# programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that
# operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that
# function. 


```


```python
# Question: 2

# Advantages of OOP:

#  1) Modular Structure:
#    It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining
#    abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.
    
#  2) Re-usability:   
#    Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software
#    also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented
#    analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.
    
#  3) Easier to maintain:
#    It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of
#    the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale
#    changes.
```


```python
# Question: 3

#  1) Function: 
#     A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to
#     operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value).
#     All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.
    
#  2) Method: 
#     A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with
#     an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key
#     differences:
   
#  The difference: 
#   A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
#   A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class.
```


```python
# Question: 4

# 1) Class: 
#    A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
#    It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects
#    of one type
        
# 2) Object:
#    Object is an instance of class that represents all the methods and properties
#    of that class. We use that instance to call the methods and properties of that
#    particular class. 

# 3) Attribute: 
#    Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state
#    or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information
#    about the instance.

# 4) Behaviour: 
#    It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an
#    object with other objects.
```


```python
# Question:  5

#Write a code in python in which create a class named it Car which
#have 5 attributes such like (model, color and name etc.) and 3
#methods. And create 5 object instance from that class.

class car:
    model = "2019"
    color = "Red"
    name = "Suzuki"
    
    def func1 (self):
        print ("Hello, I am function 1")
    def func2 (self):
        print ("Hello, I am function 2")
    def func3 (self):
        print ("Hello, I am function 3")
    
    
    obj1 = car()
    obj2 = car()
    obj3 = car()
    obj4 = car()
    obj5 = car()
